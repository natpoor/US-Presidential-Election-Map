# US-Presidential-Election-Map
US electoral college map and totals for presidential elections. You have to update the numbers manually (easy).

What the project does
This R code will show the map of the US, by state (remember though, land doesn’t vote), and color each state red or blue depending on if you put “gop” or “dem” in the (easy to see) correct spot in the file. It also shows electoral college totals for each candidate (don’t overlook how Maine and Nebraska do it, though). This little project would not be possible without R (obviously), ggplot, the usmap library, and a lot of material from the internet and Stack Overflow.

Why the project is useful
I think it’s useful because you can put in results for states before the media is allowed to legally call an outcome (after the polls close in each state), and there are a fair number of states that aren’t contested, so you can have a perhaps slightly better prediction.

How users can get started with the project
Just download it and to use it, make sure you have the usmap library installed, and then you can just update each state’s line in the code and run the code. 

Where users can get help with your project
It seems to work (although I thought it wasn’t coloring in the correct states early on, that seems to have fixed itself and I’m not sure why). The code is offered as-is. 

Who maintains and contributes to the project
Well sure I put it all together (but like I said it would not be possibly without a ton of work from other people, especially the ggplot library and obviously the usmap library, and R itself), but I’m not maintaining it, I’m just putting it up in GitHub.
